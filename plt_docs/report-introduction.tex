\section{Overview}
The bawk language, who's name is derived from `binary awk', is intended to be a small, special-purpose language for the parsing of formatted binary files.  In the spirit of awk, bawk will match rules in binary files and extract data based on these rules.  Bawk will solve the problem of quickly decoding a binary file of a known format to extract information much the way awk solves this same problem for formatted text files.

The bawk interpreter will take two inputs for execution: (1) text in the bawk langauge, and (2) binary data to run the bawk program on.  This workflow will be similar to that of a basic awk workflow, and the language itself is inspired by awk, with the same basic program construct.  That is, a program will be a series of patterns and statements, with the statements executing when their respective pattern matches.

\section{Sample program}
A representative bawk program is shown below.  This program operates on PNG format image files and will print two numbers, newline separated.  The first number is the width of the image and the second number is the height.
