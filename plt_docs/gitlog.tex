    Make pattern matching work across entire file
    
    Pattern matching now searches forward over the the entire file
    instead of expecting a match at the current location of RP.  This
    is implemented in an incredibly inefficient way, but this should
    be good enough for class.

    Initial cut at pattern variables

    type works at the moment, the namespace for variables is shared

    Add simple global variables
    
    Added simple global variables.  These are implemented as an array
    in the bytecode interpreter.  The compiler assigns each name a
    unique entry in the array.  Currently all variables are considered
    global.  Variables are not being set at an offset of FP on the stack
    because they are dynamically created and not required to be declared.

    Implement compilation of function declarations
    
    Each function declaration is preceded by a Bra call to skip over
    it in case the PC approaches it from something prior falling
    through it (e.g. at the start of the program).  This is a quicker
    hack than actually reloacting all of them after the Hlt instruction
    or something.

    bytecode.

    Reverse parsing order of pattern tokens
    
    Pattern tokens were stored in the AST in the reverse of the desired
    order.  This switches the order.

    Add parsing of hex constants in pattern expression
    
    Added parsing of hexadecimal constants in the pattern expression,
    as defined in the LRM.  Big/little endian conversion should
    probably be handled by the bytecode at runtime.

    Change string_of_operator to produce bytecode

    to bytecode operator strings.  This benefits the bytecode generation
    and makes the AST graph more concise.

    Automatic dependency generation
    
    Makefile now generates dependencies from ocamldep automatically.  It's
    a little ugly in that it makes the dependencies regardless of what the
    target is (including clean) but this is still better than manually
    updating the Makefile all the time.

    Add preliminary pattern expr constant parsing
    
    Added preliminary code to differentiate between integer constants
    in pattern expressions and those in plain expressions so they can
    be treated differently.  Pattern expression constants will always
    be interpreted in hexadecimal as a series of bytes, and plain
    expression constants will be more C-like in their interpretation.

    Make edge insertion consistent
    
    Some of the edge insertion for the GraphViz DOT generation of the
    AST was inconsistent.  Some functions assumed the caller made the
    edge and some assumed the callee, resulting in a few double or
    missing edges.  Now the caller is always required to create a
    node and a link to its parent.

    Change print_tree to print AST in dot form
    
    Changed the print_tree method to print out graphviz dot code to
    draw the tree.  This is still very crude, but it's much easier to
    visualize how the tree is being formed.
    
    To support this change the Ast_types.program type was removed, and
    now the root program is represented as a Block statement instead of
    a list of statements.  This should be a nicer overall
    representation anyway.  The parser handles the type conversion.

    Changed hex literals to require 0x prefix.  This avoids ambiguity
    with variable name literals, which are required to start with a
    letter.  (e.g. is 'ff' a variable or 255?)
